"""The `alignLyrics` runner: CTC forced alignment without the HTTP layer.

`mix` runs the vocals separator first (Separator.run_vocals), `vocals` aligns the
supplied stem directly. Needs the `lyrics` capability (+ `lyrics-ja` for
Japanese); the aligner provisions its model on first realign. Returns the
word-timed lines as structured `data` (no file artifacts). Heavy work runs off
the event loop.
