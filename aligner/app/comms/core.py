"""Transport-agnostic backend core.

A `Runner` turns one request into a list of artifacts, reporting progress
through a callback. It knows nothing about stdio / HTTP / Tauri, the transport
adapter owns that. This is the seam that lets the same backend logic serve the
local stdio sidecar and a remote HTTP/WS deployment.
