"""Pure numpy/arithmetic helpers shared by the torch (`runner.py`) and
numpy/ONNX (`np_inference.py`) separation paths.

Only the genuinely-identical pieces live here: peak normalization
(`spec_utils.normalize`) and the chunk-schedule arithmetic for both model
families. Everything that differs between the two paths (torch-tensor vs numpy
ops, config attribute vs dict access, the actual overlap-add / model calls, and
`_prepare_mix`'s numpy-path `.astype`) stays in the caller. See the two callers'
module docstrings for the audio-separator provenance.
