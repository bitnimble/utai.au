"""GPU-residency control for warm model singletons.

The pipeline worker holds several model singletons across the process
lifetime: the two drum separators (eagerly loaded at startup), the
vocals separator (lazy, /lyrics/align only), Beat This! + ADTOF
(lazy, /transcribe only), and the lyrics aligner's CTC checkpoints
(lazy). On a 6 GB consumer GPU all of these resident simultaneously
exceeds the budget once CTC forced alignment tries to allocate its
emissions tensor.

This module exposes a "park to CPU" primitive: move an nn.Module's
parameters/buffers to host RAM and `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` so the
freed VRAM is actually returned to the allocator. Unpark is the
inverse - a CUDA <-> host memcpy, ~hundreds of ms, vs reloading from
disk + state_dict which is multi-second.

Coordinator functions swap "warm but parked" sets at endpoint entry:

  - /transcribe entry   -> park lyrics models, unpark drum models
  - /lyrics/align entry -> park drum models, unpark vocals + CTC

Process-wide serialization across the two endpoints is the caller's
responsibility (see main.py::_gpu_lock); parking a model while another
request is mid-stream through it would device-mismatch the inputs.

Each helper is idempotent (a model already on the target device is a
no-op) and a no-op when the underlying model hasn't been loaded yet
(lazy-cached models start absent).
