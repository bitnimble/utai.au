"""CTC forced-alignment for lyrics.

Loads a vocals stem and produces line + word level time-aligned lyrics
using `ctc-forced-aligner` (MahmoudAshraf97/ctc-forced-aligner). The
package runs a wav2vec2-family CTC model over the FULL audio in one
pass (with internal chunking + posterior stitching) and a single
global Viterbi alignment of all the caller's lyric text against the
resulting posteriors. wav2vec2 picks each word's actual audio position
across the whole song, instead of being constrained to a
`[line.start_sec, next_line.start_sec]` search window - which breaks
down for plain-text inputs (synthesized timestamps) and for LRCLIB
matches against a different cut.

The CTC checkpoint is dispatched per-language by `_pick_alignment_model`:

  - English uses `facebook/wav2vec2-large-robust-ft-libri-960h`
    (Apache 2.0, ~317M, multi-domain robust pretraining + LS-960
    fine-tune). Tighter posteriors on English vocals than the MMS
    multilingual head because the param budget isn't shared with 1100+
    other languages, and commercial-licence-clean.
  - Everything else falls back to MMS-300m via the package's default
    (`MahmoudAshraf/mms-300m-1130-forced-aligner`, CC-BY-NC 4.0). The
    CC-BY-NC licence is a known commercial blocker for non-English
    songs and is tracked as a follow-up; OWSM-CTC v4 1B (CC-BY-4.0)
    is the current preferred replacement candidate for ja/ko/zh.

Both checkpoints share the same `<star>` wildcard mechanism (appended
at runtime by `generate_emissions`, model-agnostic) and the same
`preprocess_text(romanize=True, language=iso3)` output. Vocabs are
compatible: MMS uses uroman-romanized Latin chars and
wav2vec2-large-robust uses lowercase Latin + space + apostrophe.

Language is resolved entirely from the caller's lyric text by
`_detect_language_from_text` (script ranges + distinctive-letter
heuristics), so there is no audio-based language detector: every
script with letters routes to the MMS + uroman path, and only
genuinely letter-free text falls back to a plain `en` default.

Models are loaded **lazily** on the first /lyrics/align request rather
than eagerly at startup; the existing separator stack already eats most
of the GPU's wake-up budget, and lyrics alignment is an optional, on-
demand feature. The aligner keeps the loaded models around for
subsequent requests so warm-call latency drops to inference time only.

Memory budget on a 6 GB consumer GPU (e.g. GTX 1660 Super): the
separator pipeline unloads its model between stages, so when alignment
runs the GPU has effectively ~5 GB free. MMS-300m at fp16 peaks at
~600 MB and the English wav2vec2-large-robust head at ~650 MB, both
comfortably within that budget.

        requests for the same model path can't race.

        encoder LayerNorm/GELU on loud vocal frames, poisoning the whole

        to `<blank>` (observed as `emissions_stats: nan=~all mean=nan`
        and a downstream `get_spans` divergence). The overflow sits right
        at the fp16 threshold, so it's flaky run-to-run (cuDNN picks
        different conv algorithms) and was masked while the only
        exercised path was the stable English head; the new Japanese path
        routes through MMS-300m and trips it reliably. CPU always gets
        fp32 (no fp16 kernel coverage). The gpu_park machinery parks the
        drum + vocals models off-GPU before alignment, so MMS-300m's
        ~1.2 GB fp32 footprint fits the 6 GB budget. The returned model

    lyric text. Used by `realign_text` so we don't have to trust
    an audio-based detector - which mis-classifies the first 30 s of
    a vocals stem if the intro is silent / instrumental / background-
    vocal-only, and which on noise has been observed to return a
    `LANGUAGES_WITHOUT_SPACES` code even for English audio. That
    mis-classification then shatters every word into a per-letter
    "word" because the CTC aligner tokenises no-space languages
    character-by-character (each char becomes its own alignment unit
    and its own output entry).

    Returns an ISO-639-1 code, or `None` only when the text contains no
    alphabetic characters at all (pure punctuation / digits / empty); the
    caller then falls back to the audio-based detector. Any script with
    letters resolves here instead - Latin -> `en`, the CJK / Korean /
    Thai blocks as before, Cyrillic to a specific language via
    `_resolve_cyrillic_lang`, and every other script (Greek, Hebrew,
    Indic, ...) to the `_OTHER_SCRIPT_LANG` catch-all. All of the
    non-`en` codes route to the MMS-300m + uroman pathway, so we no
    longer drop a non-Latin lyric onto the (slower, less reliable) audio
    detector just because its script wasn't counted.

    **Routing rule: majority by character count.** Each alphabetic
    character votes for one language; the language with the most votes
    wins. This handles bilingual code-switching by following the bulk
    of the text rather than letting any sprinkle of non-Latin script
    flip the whole song. An English-dominant lyric with a few kana
    ad-libs routes to `en` (so it picks up the English-specialized
    aligner); a J-pop song whose verses are mostly Japanese still
    routes to `ja` even if the chorus is English, because the
    verse-character count dwarfs the chorus character count over the
    whole song. The trade-off is a bilingual *line* whose English
    word-count exceeds its Japanese char-count routes to `en` - that's
    a deliberate acceptance, because (a) one bilingual line isn't
    representative of a whole song's character distribution and (b)
    routing to a non-English aligner for an English-majority body
    fragments worse than the inverse.

    For genuinely ambiguous CJK characters (kanji/hanzi, glyph-
    identical between Japanese and Traditional Chinese), the ja/zh
    mapping uses a two-signal heuristic *before* counting:
      - any kana anywhere -> CJK counts as ja
      - any simplified-Chinese-only marker, no kana -> CJK counts as zh
      - otherwise -> CJK counts as ja (J-pop bias for ambiguous text)

    Pure ties (rare in practice) are broken by `counts` dict iteration
    order (`en` first), because Latin is the most common script in
    pop music globally and wav2vec2-EN handles Romance / Germanic
    Latin-script text reasonably.

    """Re-run forced alignment locally for every word scoring below
    `score_threshold`.

    The global Viterbi occasionally lands on degenerate solutions where
    one word's frame assignment spans many seconds of audio the model
    couldn't phoneme-match (held vowel after the word, breath, ad-lib,
    instrumental gap). The standard `<star>` absorber isn't usable on
    speech-active frames because real wav2vec2 outputs near-zero
    posterior to the `<star>` column at speech frames; this helper
    re-aligns each pathological word locally with a small window of
    well-aligned neighbors as anchors. Two reasons a local rerun can
    win where the global pass lost:
      - The package's internal 30 s chunking + posterior stitching
        introduces cross-chunk boundary effects; aligning a short
        window avoids them entirely.
      - The local Viterbi minimisation is over a much smaller trellis;
        a stretched-word path that was globally optimal can lose to a
        tighter alternative locally because the gain from "stretching
        the next word too" no longer applies.

    Conservative accept-gate: replace the local cluster's timings only
    when the targeted bad word's score strictly improves. A no-op
    rerun (same audio + same text + same package = same path) never
    makes things worse, and a regression on the targeted word means
    something about the local context is also broken and we don't want
    to propagate that into neighbours either.

    Default threshold `-5.0` is roughly the median score on a typical
    pop vocals stem aligned with MMS-300m; tune lower (e.g. `-10`) to
    target only the worst handful of words, higher to be more
    aggressive at the cost of compute on many no-op reruns."""
