"""Two-stage drum separation: full mix -> drum stem -> per-instrument stems.

Stage `stems_all` uses **BS-Roformer SW** (jarredou's BS-ROFO-SW-Fixed) to
extract a drum stem from the full mix — a 6-stem (vocals / drums / bass /
guitar / piano / other) Band-Split RoPE Transformer chosen over htdemucs_ft
for its substantially cleaner drum stem (drums SDR ~14 vs ~10), especially
its preservation of high-frequency cymbal / hi-hat transients, which is
what Stage 2 then has to split. Stage `stems_per` uses the **jarredou
5-stem MDX23C DrumSep** model to break the drum stem into
kick / snare / toms / hi-hat / cymbals. Note: this 5-stem model merges
ride + crash into a single `cymbals` stem (see `STEM_NAME_TO_PITCH`).

Both stages run through a vendored, torch-only separation wrapper
(`pipeline/separation/`), reimplemented from `audio-separator`'s chunked
overlap-add (validated bit-exact against it) so we can drop the dependency,
surface per-chunk progress, keep stems in memory, and export the model bodies
to ONNX for cross-platform GPU backends (opt in with `UTAI_SEP_ONNX`).
`pipeline/provision.py` fetches the weights on startup. The /lyrics vocals
stem also comes from Stage-1 BS-Roformer SW (its `vocals` output, cleaner than
the retired UVR-MDX-NET-Voc_FT), so `audio-separator` is no longer used at all.

Failure modes intentionally surface up to the caller - if the drum-piece
separator can't find a kick, we just won't emit candidates for the kick lane
and the LLM has to infer the kick pattern from context (in practice it can't,
so this is mostly a "log and let the user retry" path).
